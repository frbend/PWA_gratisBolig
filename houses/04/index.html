                <h2>Property description</h2>
                <p class="desc">Spacious, well-appointed, timeless, full-walled villa that appears new. Situated close to the forest - in fully developed detached house with path system for school, town center, etc. The house's location on the maintenance-intact grounds
                    provides a framework for uninterrupted moments on the lovely terrace, which is partially covered - and faces south and west. The house also includes a double carport with insulated outbuilding / workshop and attic. The decor is ideal
                    both for the family with smaller children and for the one with the noisy teenagers as the large children's rooms are located at both ends of the house. Everywhere in the house there is air and elbow room. Still, the "heart" of the
                    home - the family's natural gathering place - is the family room, where the many windows to both the east and west provide an amazing light through.
